# Insurance Cost Prediction

![](dataset-cover.jpg)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of predicting insurance costs using machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning (ML), and deep neural networks. The notebook is based on the [Insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/data) available on Kaggle.

## Dataset Overview

The Insurance dataset contains information about individuals including their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and insurance charges. This dataset is commonly used for predictive modeling tasks, particularly for estimating insurance costs based on individual characteristics.

## Notebook Contents
The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository covers the following steps:

1- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and remove duplicate values

2- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations and statistical analyses are performed to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among different features in the dataset.

3- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Several machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regressor, and random forest regressor are implemented to predict insurance costs. The models are trained, evaluated, and compared using appropriate metrics.

4- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: A deep neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow/Keras to predict insurance costs. The model architecture, training process, and evaluation results are presented.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* TensorFlow/Keras
